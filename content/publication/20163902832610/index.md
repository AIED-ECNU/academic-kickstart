abstract: "In the past three decades, with the fast development of China's economy, the business data of electric power industry also showed rapid growth and the data size is continual expanding. Thus, the management systems of electric enterprise groups encountered the performance bottlenecks of massive data processing. Hadoop is an open-source software framework developed for reliable, scalable, and efficient distributed computing and storage, and is widely used in massive data processing. Based on the study of the proposed massive business data processing of electric industry, this paper introduces a novel architecture, which is based on Hadoop ecosystem, for management systems of electric enterprise groups to crack the present performance bottlenecks. First, the business logic and processing produce of management system is analyzed. Then new architecture with Hadoop based distributed processing model is introduced in detailed. At last, experimental results with actual business scenarios and data prove the architecture can effectively resolve present performance bottlenecks of massive business data processing, and greatly improve the performance and efficiency of the management system of electric enterprise groups.textlessbr/textgreater &copy; 2016 IEEE."
